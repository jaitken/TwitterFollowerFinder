# TwitterFollowerFinder
A couple python scripts that creates a list of potential followers and then goes through and follows each person on that list
The list is created by looking at target accounts followers and recording all common followers between target accounts

Using the free twitter API and tweepy library for python
The free twitter api is severly limited, creating a list of all of an accounts followers takes an incredible amount of time
(only able to get ~1000 followers per hour)
