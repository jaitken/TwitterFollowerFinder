# Twitter Follower Finder

Using the free twitter API and tweepy library for python.


A couple python scripts that create a list of potential followers and follows each person on that list or unfollows anyone who has not followed you back.
The list of potential followers is generated by filtering for matches in lists of targeted account's followers.


Using the free twitter API and tweepy library for python.
The free twitter api locks you out every couple hundred calls for 15 mins, with this constraint you can only grab around 1000 followers per hour and so the time to generate the list and then follow every account can take a long time.
